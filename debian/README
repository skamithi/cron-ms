The Debian Package cron-ms
----------------------------

The following description is taken from the source website


Did you ever want to run a program every few seconds, or even fractions of a
second, under a linux, unix, bsd or osx cron script? Here's an elegant script
that does just that.
Features:
Runs as a service - does not need cron
Launches multiple programs in parallel
Multiple time periods supported simultaneously just by the directory name
2 companion programs to support odd time periods like 37 seconds or 37 minutes
All standard bash stuff that should run on any *nix systems
Monit script included to keep it alive
Simple, elegant, documented, complete, free
It just works
